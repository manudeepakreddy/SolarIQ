Column	Meaning
MODEL	Unique model name (e.g., lstm_Model_0)
MODEL_DESCRIPTION	Format: [(input shape), forecast horizon, dilation?, filters, dropout]
FORECAST_HORIZON	Number of future hours predicted (always 24 here)
PAST_HISTORY	Number of past time steps used (168 = 1 week)
BATCH_SIZE	Samples processed per training step (256)
EPOCHS	Training cycles (each full pass over data)
mse, rmse	Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error on test data
nrmse	Normalized RMSE (helps compare across scales)
mae	Mean Absolute Error (average size of error)
wape	Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (scaled error)
val_*	Validation metrics (on unseen validation set)
loss, val_loss	Per-epoch loss values (training & validation)



Metric	Ideal Trend
rmse, mae	Lower is better
nrmse	Should be <10%
wape	Closer to 0 is better
val_*	Should be close to train values, or model is overfitting



 Why LSTM?
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
Purpose: Captures long-term dependencies in sequential data (e.g., time-series).

Why it’s useful for solar prediction:

Weather patterns and solar output have temporal memory — e.g., cloud patterns affect the next few hours.

LSTM learns how earlier events influence later ones.

Strength: Good at modeling delayed effects and temporal trends over days.

Example:
If solar irradiance drops every day at 6 PM, LSTM learns this long-term sequence.

⚡ Why DCCNN?
DCCNN (Deep Causal Convolutional Neural Network):
Purpose: Detects local patterns and variations over time (like trends or spikes).

“Causal” means the model doesn't use future information — it predicts based only on past.

Why it’s useful for solar prediction:

Quickly identifies short-term fluctuations like passing clouds, sudden weather shifts.

Efficient and faster to train than LSTM.

 Example:
If irradiance drops suddenly due to cloud cover, CNN detects it immediately in a few timesteps.



Model	Limitations
Random Forest / XGBoost	Can't model sequential memory; treats time steps as features
Vanilla LSTM	Misses local trends and fine-grained fluctuations
GRU	Slightly faster, but less expressive than LSTM for longer sequences
CNN Only	Misses long-term dependencies; great for short-term only
Transformer	Very powerful, but needs a huge dataset + compute power to outperform DCCNN+LSTM
Linear/ARIMA	Too simple; can't capture non-linear solar patterns or weather influence
